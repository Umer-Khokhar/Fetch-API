# Fetch API's
This README provides an overview of Fetch APIs, which are a set of web platform APIs that enable fetching resources (such as JSON data, images, or documents) across the network.

## What is Fetch API?
Fetch API is a modern replacement for the traditional XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, providing a more powerful and flexible feature set for making HTTP requests. It is built into the JavaScript global object, making it available in both browser-based JavaScript and server-side Node.js environments.

The Fetch API provides a simple and consistent interface for making requests and handling responses using the fetch() function. It returns a promise that resolves to the response from the server.
